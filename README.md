# AI Resume Enhancer (n8n Workflow)

This project is an **AI-powered resume enhancement workflow** built using [n8n](https://n8n.io), integrated with OpenAI and Google Drive. It takes your existing resume content and intelligently tailors it to match any job description — formatting it into a polished Google Doc that’s ready to submit.

This tool was designed to help job seekers, especially those in data analytics, customize their resumes with minimal effort.

## Features

- Connects with OpenAI API (GPT-4/GPT-3.5) for resume enhancement
- Formats output into a clean, styled HTML resume
- Saves the enhanced resume directly to a Google Drive folder
- Uses dynamic job descriptions and company names for personalized titles
- Works as an n8n workflow (modular and scalable)

## How It Works (Workflow Overview)

1. **Input Resume Content**: Original resume text (from markdown, plain text, or HTML).
2. **Fetch Job Description**: Pull job title and description dynamically or manually.
3. **Send to OpenAI**: Craft a prompt that asks the AI to reformat your resume for that job.
4. **Format HTML Output**: Clean and wrap the AI-enhanced content in styled HTML.
5. **Upload to Google Docs**: Create a new document titled with the company name and date, saved in a chosen Drive folder.
